            <h2>1. Zoomies!</h2>
            <p>Does your furrball run at an enormously fast speed and bounce off of the couch? No need to fear! Despite getting all the food they need from their pet parents, cats are innate hunters and have a predatory instinct. Sometimes it may seem as if your cat is chasing nothing, when, more than likely, they're pursuing imaginary prey. To get a sense of your kitty's expert hunting skills, toss a few pieces of kibble down the hallway and see how quickly they bound after it.</p>

                <p>When your cat "winks" at you, is it flirting? That might be one way to interpret the kitty eye communication, sometimes called a cat kiss. A slow cat-eye blink is a wonderful compliment. It is a non-threat signal that cats use with each other as well as with humans they are comfortable with. You can send the same signal to your cat, slowly shutting and then opening your eyes. Chances are, your cat will return the cat-kiss eye blink.</p>

                <p>Cats knead or make biscuits, is believed to be a leftover nursing behavior that kittens use to stimulate the release of milk from their mothers. In adult cats, you will mostly see it as away to express happiness and comfort, mark their scent on objects, show affection, stretch their muscles, and express their desire to mate. When a cat makes biscuits, especially on a human, it means the cat is showing you it loves you and returns your affection.</p>
